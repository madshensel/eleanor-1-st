### Large files
Due to git's LFS acting up all psd, psb files are split up to stay under 100MB.

### Design
Based on a kids imagination. It's starts with tracing a basic letter shape and then the rules stop.

Current font styles:

| Name                 | Weight class
| -------------------- | ----------------
| Bold                 | 700
